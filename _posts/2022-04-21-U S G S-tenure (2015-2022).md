I got a great opportunity to work at USGS and develop the open source COAWST model for seven years. It was only possible with the help of the scientists there - John Warner, 
Neil Ganju, Chris Sherwood, Rich Signell, Alfredo Aretxabaleta, Zafer Defne from the permanent staff at the time. Everyone had different strengths and came from different
angles to solve a problem. I was lucky to use their ideas and synthesize them into the model or apply those ideas for successful application of the model. I also had a huge amount of help from the postdocs and in my time
I had the opportunity to work with Ilgar Safak, Alexis Beudin, Julia Moriarty, Christie Hegermiller, Dan Nowacki, Salme Cook, Rachel Allen. I was also allowed to collaborate
with professors at other institutions that included WHOI, Boston Univ., Univ. of Delaware, Univ. of Maryland, Duke Univ., Oregon State Univ., Univ. of Florida, Florida Atlantic Univ., North Carolina State Univ., Univ. of Liverpool
, and our sister offices of St. Pete and Santa Cruz.  These colloborations were highly rewarding. In my seven years of working at USGS, I had 15 publications and 5 of them were my first author contributions. My first two-three years
were quite challenging because I had moved from aerospace to coastal science and that required me to catch up with the basic concepts of this(coastal science) field. I had to show my skills
by building wrapper codes. . My biggest strength was my intense PhD training that allowed me to go into any code, simplify complex problems, communicate and write effectively. 
Other than modeling, Rich Signell's presence in the group and my own interest in high performance computing led me to learn several concepts including cloud computing, using python tools for faster data processing. Here is a timeline of what I did and when I made major contributions to my work in Woods Hole.
