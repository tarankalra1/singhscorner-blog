Hi, I am Taran and I am writing this blog to share my experiences from two different flavors of numerical modeling. 

I would also share some of my personal thoughts on the tools that I have learnt along the way. The blog's purpose is to preserve some of my notes and may be start a conversation with a fellow modeler/computational scientist/CFD developers and users.

My background is:
* Currently working as Computing Scientist to develop a coupled ocean-wave-atmosphere model at US Geological Survey, Woods Hole.
* B.S, M.S., Ph.D in aerospace engineering with focus on CFD modeling of laboratory scale rotors.

A list of my research papers can be found here:
