I am taking courses on Machine learning using tensorflow. From the first two courses, here is a summary of what I have learnt. 
Inputs -> outputs 
Find the rules that caused output from inputs
Examples could be 

1. y = f(x) find their relationship 
2. Classification of different images with numbers from 0 to 9. The training set is already there with images marked prior to classification. 
3. Classification of dogs and cats (automatic and without any prior knowledge of the classifying patterns)
