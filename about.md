Hi, I am Taran and I am writing this blog to share my experiences from two different flavors of numerical modeling. I am currently working as a Computing Scientist to develop and apply the coupled ocean-wave-atmosphere model at US Geological Survey, Woods Hole. 

I would also share some of my personal thoughts on the tools that I have learnt along the way. The blog's purpose is to preserve some of my notes and may be start a conversation with a fellow modeler/computational scientist/CFD developers and users.

A list of my research papers can be found here:
